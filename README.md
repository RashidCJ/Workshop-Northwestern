# Workshop-Northwestern
A workshop on entity resolution across multilingual settings for political scientists

Participants will have at their disposal the HTML and Python notebook to follow along, which they may download by using the above green code button and selecting Download ZIP, or click this [link](https://github.com/RashidCJ/Workshop-Northwestern/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), and even experiment with as the workshop takes place. The HTML/Python file requires the accompanying images be present in the same directory/folder as the .html or .ipynb file is located in.

Although not necessary to follow the workshop, I include here the source .ipynb file. I recommend downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and [Anaconda Navigator](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/anaconda-navigator) and installing Python and Jupyter (Notebooks or Labs) to run this file, or Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), as well as particular packages such as pandas, numpy, sparse_dot_topn, sklearn, and scipy. 

Instructions to install these packages, as well as a general and fast introduction to Python, can be located in the html or ipynb in section 1.4. 

If you have questions, do not hesitate to contact me at rmarcano@indiana.edu or rmarcano@iu.edu, and I will try to respond as soon as possible.
